# Very basic gene finding/annotation tutorial

We will analyze two genomes, one from prokaryote and one from eukaryote - 
Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Candida albicans A123 respectively. 
We will use two standard tools for finding genes, i.e. Prodigal (`https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal`) and Augustus(`https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/Augustus`).

## Prokaryotic gene annotation

### Step 1: Obtain data files

Try and navigate the links and obtain the data yourselves (raw sequence (contigs/scaffolds) without annotation). 
In this particular example we will work with NCBI database, alternative databases are European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) 
that you might be using in you project. Try to download both to the server and your computer as well.
